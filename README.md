# azure-comment-moderation

This is a quick example of how to use Azure's Cognitive Services content moderation API in React.
You can find more documentation of how to setup and register for an API key at the Microsoft [Azure Product Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/api-reference) page.

You will need to rename sample.env to .env and add your API key to that file in order for it to work!
